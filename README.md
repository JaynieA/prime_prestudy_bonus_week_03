* [x] Create three functions, each taking in a single number.
* [x] Then do something to that number and return a new number.
* [x] Then call each of those functions in one giant chain.

| Function Name | What it does               |
| --------------|----------------------------|
| add           | add 2 to the number        |
| multiply      | multiply the number by 2   |
| subtract      | subtract 4 from the number |


Assuming that you set this up correctly, you should get a numerical return that is a combination of all the functions running, taking in a function in the place of a number.
